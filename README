# OVERVIEW #

Files for defining CF compliant metadata for climate indices' data variable.

All necessary information is kept in a LibreOffice Calc .ods file containing the master table. 

In addition the repository contains the master table in alternative file formats. 

All changes to the LibreOffice .ods file must be exported to the alternative formats (this will not be done automagically). Changes must only be done in the master table, i.e. the LibreOffice Calc .ods file.       

---------------

The repository contains the following files:

1.  climate_indices_CV20.ods 

The master table of index variable metadata as a LibreOffice spreadsheet file. This file contains a macro for exporting the table to 'flat' .json file (a .csv is created in an intermediate step). The resulting .csv and .json files will have the same name as the parent file (i.e. climate_indices_CV20.json, and climate_indices_CV20.csv


2.  climate_indices_CV20.fods

Flat xml representation of the master table (prduced by LibreOffice export)


3.  climate_indices_CV20.xlsx

Excel (zip archive) representation of the master table (prduced by LibreOffice export)


4.  climate_indices_CV20.csv   and   climate_indices_CV20.json

Files produced by the LibreOffice macro. The .csv file is an intermediate file towards producing the .json file.


5  jsonFlat2Hierarchial.py

Python script for transforming the 'flat' .json (produced by the LibreOffice macro) file into a 'hierarchical' .json file. The transformation rules are specified in a separate .json file. Indices that cannot be parsed according to the rule set are logged to stderr. Example run command: 
python jsonFlat2Hierarchial.py translationRules.json < climate_indices_CV20.json > climate_indices_CV20_DEF.json 2>errors.txt


6.  translationRules.json

Definition of the rule set used by jsonFlat2Hierarchial.py

 

7.  climate_indices_CV20_DEF.json

The successfully translated indices produced by jsonFlat2Hierarchial.py


8.  errors.txt


The indices that could not be translated by jsonFlat2Hierarchial.py. In additon to a listing of the input .json text the file includes rudimentary error information.


9.  listMissingItems.py

Python script that lists empty/placeholder text in otherwise successfully translated indices. Example run command:
python listMissingItems.py < climate_indices_CV20_DEF.json > climate_indices_CV20_DEF_missing.txt



10.  climate_indices_CV20_DEF_missing.txt

List of missing/placeholder items.
