# CF compliant metadata for the data variable in climate index netCDF files. #


## Overview ##

The main function is to provide a unified view of metadata required to describe
climate indices (aka climate indicators) following, as far as possible, the 
Climate and Forecasting [CF] Convention. 

This repository is in active development, and the content will frequently change. 

Currently it contains a LibreOffice Calc file, **master_table.fods**, containing several sheets.

The sheets are as follows:
* ``index_table``  ---  the main table holding the metadata for the individual indices
* ``variables``  ---  specification of input variables (following CMIP5/6 and CORDEX rules
* ``index_functions``  ---  some details related to code snippets (external) for calculation of the indices
